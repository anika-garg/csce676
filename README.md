# News Recommendation Data Mining Project (MIND Dataset)

This project explores the MIND (Microsoft News Dataset) to analyze user news consumption behavior using core data mining techniques and advanced modeling approaches. The goal is to understand interaction sparsity, popularity bias, temporal behavior, and topic structure in large-scale news recommendation data.
